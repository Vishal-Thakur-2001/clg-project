		<h1 >About this project.</h1>
		<p> <span class="highlight-text"> My name is Sarabjeet Singh </span> , I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow my skillset. That's why when I was given a project to create a website using HTML, CSS, and JS, I knew I wanted to create something unique and visually appealing. After some brainstorming, I decided to create a wallpaper download website that would allow users to browse and download high-quality wallpapers for their desktops, laptops, or mobile devices.  </p>

		<p>	The first step in the process was to research and gather inspiration for the design of the website. I looked at different websites that offer similar services and analyzed their layouts, color schemes, and navigation structures. I took note of what worked well and what didn't and used this information to guide the design of my website. </p>
			
			<p>Once I had a solid idea of what I wanted my website to look like, I began coding using HTML, CSS, and JS. I started with the basic structure of the website, including the header, footer, and navigation menu. Next, I added in the content, which included a wide variety of wallpapers organized into categories such as nature, abstract, animals, and more. </p>
			
			<p>To make the website more user-friendly, I implemented a search function that allows users to search for specific wallpapers based on keywords. I also included a feature that allows users to filter wallpapers by resolution to ensure they download the perfect wallpaper for their device.</p>
			
			<p>As I was coding, I frequently tested the website to ensure it was functioning correctly and made adjustments as needed. I also made sure the website was responsive so that it would look great on any device, from a desktop computer to a mobile phone.</p>
			
			<p>In the end, I was extremely proud of the final product. Creating this website allowed me to apply the coding skills I learned in class to a real-world project, and I gained valuable experience in web design and development. I'm excited to see where this project will take me in the future and look forward to continuing to develop my skills as a web developer.</p>
